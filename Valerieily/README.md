Now-a-days, I don't know why but I don't feel like I'm interested in any kind of stuff. I just want to be with you, spend time with you. I feel like driving to some lake, and looking up at the sky full of stars and the beautiful moon, by leaning my head on your lap, and listening to you, telling me how your day is by moving your fingers through my hair... All I can feel at that exact moment is "I'm sooo... glad that I have you in my life!!!"
